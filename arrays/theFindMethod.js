// We can use the Find Method to retrieve 1 Element of an Array based on a condition
// The Find Method also accepts a Condition and a Callback Function which will then be called as the Method loops over the Array.
// Unlike the Filter Method, the Find Method won't return a new Array, it will only return the First Element in the Array that satisfies this Condition
// It will Return The 1st Element in the Array for which this operation here becomes True

console.log(firstWithdrawal); // -400

// 2 Fundamental Differences between the Filter Method and the Find Method
// 1st, Filter returns ALL the Elements, that match the Condition while the Find Method ONLY Returns the 1st one
// 2nd, MORE IMPORTANT, The Filter Method Returns A NEW ARRAY while Find Method ONLY Returns the Element itself and not an Array

// With the Find Method I can find an Object in the Array based on some Property of that Object
// As I loop over 'accounts' (each of the Current Elements is ONE Account)
// And now I want to select 1 of the accounts by the name
////const account = accounts.find(acc => acc.owner === 'Jessica Davis');
////console.log(account); // {owner: 'Jessica Davis', movements: Array(8), interestRate: 1.5, pin: 2222}
// Using the Find Method we can then search this Array to find an Object that MATCHES A CERTAIN PROPERTY that we already know.
// Filter Method compares 'Jessica Davis' with the 'acc.owner', and whenever this Condition is True, then THAT Object is Returned.

// So usually the GOAL of the Find Method is to just FIND exactly One Element and therefore we usually set up a Condition where only 1 Element can satisfy that condition.
// That's why we used the '===' Operator here.
