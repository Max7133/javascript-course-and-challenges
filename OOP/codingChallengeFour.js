// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private;
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. They experiment with chining!

DATA CAR 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€

// so from Outside there is No Way of changing it, except of course by 'chargeBattery()' or by 'accelerate()'

rivian
  .accelerate() // Rivian is going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22
  .accelerate() // Rivian is going at 160 km/h, with a charge of 21

// Child Class 'EVCl' does also Inherit the Getters and Setters from the 'CarCl' Parent Class.
// So I can also do this..
// speedUS is a Setter and a Getter that I defined in the Parent Class 'CarCl'
console.log(rivian.speedUS); // 121.875 (this is 195 km/h converted to mi/h)
